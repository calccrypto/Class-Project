Fix OpenPGP encrypt/decrypt hash bug
send packet length before sending packet to avoid having to break up packet or make all packets really long to avoid breaking up packets
hide user input when typing in password
make crashing safer
stop waiting if failed to packetize/unpacketize
Make server stopping also force client (not client thread; that is already done) to stop
Figure out why server thread won't stop after typing in quit
Make it so that when one side fails, the other side resets
currently not taking care of most cases when packets are larger than PACKET_SIZE
remove debug messages(after coding is done)
change error messages to be more generic (to avoid account enumeration and other attacks)
