**Fix OpenPGP encrypt/decrypt hash bug**
**Make this stateless**
hide user input when typing in password
make crashing safer
Make server stopping also force client (not client thread; that is already done) to stop
Figure out why server thread won't stop after typing in quit
change error messages to be more generic (to avoid account enumeration and other attacks)
master key to decrypt KDC subkeys
prevent too many login attempts on same account
missing error message if server crashes before client stops
add try/catch for things in OpenPGP that can throw
OpenPGP CFB encrypt/decrypt is being weird
