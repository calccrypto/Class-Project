**Fix OpenPGP encrypt/decrypt hash bug**
hide user input when typing in password
make crashing safer
stop waiting if failed to packetize/unpacketize
Make server stopping also force client (not client thread; that is already done) to stop
Figure out why server thread won't stop after typing in quit
Make it so that when one side fails, the other side resets
remove debug messages(after coding is done)
change error messages to be more generic (to avoid account enumeration and other attacks)
master key to decrypt KDC subkeys
prevent too many login attempts on same account
missing error message if server crashes before client stops
add try/catch for things in OpenPGP that can throw
listening socket in client for talking to another client
send_packets/recv_packets moving bad data for some reason. Leftover data in sock is messing with communications
do not decrypt user data that is in memory until it is necessary 
    - encrypt (user name + shared key encrypted with kh + hash) with kdc master key
