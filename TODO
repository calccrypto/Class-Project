**Fix OpenPGP encrypt/decrypt bug**
hide user input when typing in password
Figure out why server thread won't stop after typing in quit
change error messages to be more generic (to avoid account enumeration and other attacks)
master key to decrypt KDC subkeys
missing error message if server crashes before client stops
add try/catch for things in OpenPGP that can throw
OpenPGP CFB encrypt/decrypt is being weird
add authenticator to each message sent from client to client
multiple processes cannot listen to the same port at once, so multiple clients cannot listen to the same port
