OpenPGP (https://github.com/calccrypto/OpenPGP), and
its dependencies are required to build this project.
The makefile assumes that the folder containing this
project is in the same directory as OpenPGP. Please
change the linking directory if this is not so.

Once all of the necessary files are available, run
make to build the server and client programs. OpenPGP
will be built if it has not already been built.
